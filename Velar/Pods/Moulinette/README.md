    1. New rules conform to the `SwiftRule` protocol in `SwiftRule.swift`.
    2. Comment the rule:
        1. A comment explaining what the rule is checking should be present before the class declaration.
        2. Each methods (public / private / internal) should be commented and their behavior explained.
    3. Create the Unit Tests for the rule or create a task on Trello to remind to do it.
        1. If you create the unit tests:
            - Comment every test with a clear explanation of what you're testing and what you're expecting.
        2. If you create a task on Trello.
            - Comment the task and provide  edge cases that the rule should cover and their expectations.
4. Make a PR.
    1. Add all the PiOS Moulinette members in the PR.
    2. Only 2 approvals are required for merging the rule.
    3. Explain in your PR what your rule is testing and provided urls for your story and any other story related to this rule (eg: Provide also unit test link even if not made).
